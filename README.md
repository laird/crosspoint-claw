# CrossPoint OpenClaw — AI-Curated E-Reader

This is a fork of [CrossPoint Reader](CROSSPOINT-README.md) that extends it with **AI-driven content delivery**: an RSS feed pipeline that lets a personal AI agent (OpenClaw/Chip) automatically generate, package, and push content — news digests, EPUBs, markdown articles, sleep screen art, and firmware updates — directly to the device over WiFi.

---

## ⚡ Quick Install

> **Requirements:** Chrome or Edge browser (Web Serial API required — Firefox not supported)

**Step 1 — Download the firmware**

Download `firmware.bin` from the [latest release](https://github.com/laird/crosspoint-claw/releases/latest).

**Step 2 — Open the installer**

Go to **[https://xteink.dve.al/](https://xteink.dve.al/)** and connect your Xteink X4 via USB-C. Wake/unlock the device, then click the connect button on the site and select your device from the browser's serial port prompt.

**Step 3 — Flash the firmware**

Scroll down to the **"OTA fast flash controls"** section. Click **Choose File**, select the `firmware.bin` you downloaded, then click **Flash**. The progress bar will fill as it uploads. When complete, the device reboots automatically into CrossPoint OpenClaw.

> **To revert** to official CrossPoint firmware, use the **"Flash CrossPoint firmware"** button on [https://xteink.dve.al/](https://xteink.dve.al/), or swap back via [https://xteink.dve.al/debug](https://xteink.dve.al/debug).

## What this fork adds

### RSS Feed Sync

The device polls an RSS feed server on every WiFi connect and automatically downloads new content to the SD card. Supported content types:

| Type | Extension | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| EPUB books | `.epub` | Full e-reader support |
| Articles / news | `.md`, `.txt` | Rendered natively |
| Sleep screen art | `.bmp` | Displayed on sleep screen |
| Firmware updates | `.bin` | Flashed on next boot |

The feed server runs anywhere on your local network (or internet). A simple Python HTTP server with an RSS XML feed is all that's needed. See `docs/rss-content-feeds.md` for the full feed format spec.

**Smart deduplication:** Items are deduplicated by timestamp + file-exists + size check — not just GUID. This means the device never re-downloads files that are already on the SD card, even after a firmware reflash wipes GUID history.

**Skip sync:** Hold Up or Down at WiFi connect to suppress the sync for that session — useful when you want to connect without triggering a 70-file download.

---

### OTA Safety — Never Overwrite the Running Firmware

This fork is strict about OTA partition safety:

- **Always writes to the inactive partition** — the currently-running firmware is never touched
- **Firmware.bin deleted from SD after any flash attempt** (success or failure) — no flash loops
- **SHA-based GUID check** — the device won't re-flash firmware it's already running
- **ESP-IDF rollback** — if new firmware crashes before calling `markValid()`, the bootloader automatically rolls back to the previous partition

The result: there is always a known-good firmware in the inactive partition as a fallback.

---

### Pulsr Theme

A custom theme (upstream only includes Classic and Lyra) with:

- Clean top bar showing WiFi/Feed status pills and battery
- Feed sync progress states: FEED → SYNC → n/total → DONE / ERR
- **Version string right-aligned in the top bar** — `1.1.1-claw (44a2001)` visible on every screen
- File transfer screen live-updates as content arrives from the feed

---

### Hidden System Logs

System log files are stored in `/.crosspoint/` on the SD card — invisible in the library browser (which filters dot-prefixed names) but still accessible via the web API:

| File | Purpose | API endpoint |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `/.crosspoint/boot.log` | Boot events and OTA flash results | `GET /api/boot-log` |
| `/.crosspoint/ota_error.log` | OTA error details | `GET /api/boot-log` |
| `/.crosspoint/feed_sync_time.txt` | Timestamp of last successful sync | internal |

---

### Danger Zone — Remote OTA & Auto-Connect

The **Danger Zone** (enabled in Settings → SYST) unlocks remote management:

- **Auto-connect on boot**: device rejoins known WiFi automatically, no manual interaction needed
- **Background web server**: file upload, EPUB management, and feed sync all accessible via browser while reading
- **Remote OTA flash**: push new firmware to the SD card and it flashes on next sleep/wake
- **QR code on boot**: device lands on the file transfer screen after auto-connect, ready to receive content

### Web Interface

Once connected, the full web interface is accessible from any browser on the network — upload EPUBs, browse files, trigger syncs, and push firmware.

### OpenClaw / Chip Integration

**OpenClaw** is a personal AI agent (Claude Sonnet, running as `claude-code`) that acts as the content brain for the device. It:

- Generates daily news digests as markdown files and pushes them via RSS
- Summarises and packages articles into readable `.md` or `.epub` files
- Creates sleep screen artwork (`.bmp`) tailored to the reader's preferences
- Monitors the feed server and triggers firmware updates autonomously
- Runs the full build → deploy → flash → verify loop without human intervention

The reader becomes a **passive delivery target**: Chip generates content on a schedule, the device syncs on boot, and new reading material appears automatically.

## How it works end to end

```
OpenClaw/Chip (AI agent)
    │
    │  generates content, builds firmware
    ▼
Feed Server (Python HTTP, local network)
    │  serves RSS feed + files at http://192.168.x.x:8090/feed.xml
    ▼
CrossPoint Device (ESP32-C3, Xteink X4)
    │  syncs on WiFi connect, downloads new items to SD card
    │  flashes firmware on next boot if firmware.bin present (version-checked)
    ▼
Reader (you)
    opens new articles, books, and art — automatically delivered
```

## Setup

### 1. Flash CrossPoint OpenClaw firmware

Use the web flasher at https://xteink.dve.al/ with a firmware build from this fork, or follow the USB flash instructions in [Development — Safe Flash](#safe-usb-flash).

### 2. Enable Danger Zone

On the device:
1. Settings → SYST tab → toggle **Danger Zone** ON
2. Tap **Danger Zone Password** → set a password
3. Reboot

After reboot, the device auto-connects to WiFi and shows the QR code screen.

### 3. Start a feed server

```bash
# Minimal feed server (Python)
cd /path/to/your/feed/content
python3 -m http.server 8090
```

See `docs/rss-content-feeds.md` for the full feed format spec and `scripts/crosspoint-feed-server.py` for a production-ready feed server with directory auto-scanning.

### 4. Configure the feed URL on the device

Settings → NETW → Feed URL → `http://192.168.x.x:8090/feed.xml`

---

## Development

### Prerequisites

- **PlatformIO** (VS Code extension or CLI: `pip install platformio`)
- **Python 3** (for i18n code generation and flash scripts)
- **USB cable** (for initial flash only — after that, everything is OTA)

### Clone and Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/laird/crosspoint-claw.git
cd crosspoint-claw
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build firmware
pio run
```

### Safe USB Flash

> ⚠️ **Always commit before flashing.** The feed server identifies firmware by SHA. If you flash uncommitted code, the feed re-downloads the old firmware on next sync and overwrites your work. `flash-crosspoint.sh` enforces this with a pre-flight check.

Use `scripts/crosspoint-flash.py` — an OTA-aware flash script that always writes to the **inactive** partition and preserves the running firmware as a rollback fallback:

```bash
# Prerequisites: esptool in a venv
pip install esptool

# Check partition state without flashing
python3 scripts/crosspoint-flash.py --status --port /dev/cu.usbmodem101

# Build, commit-check, update feed, and flash safely (wrapper script)
scripts/flash-crosspoint.sh

# Or flash a pre-built binary directly
python3 scripts/crosspoint-flash.py .pio/build/default/firmware.bin --port /dev/cu.usbmodem101
```

**What the script does:**
1. Reads `otadata` to determine which partition (app0/app1) is currently active
2. Flashes new firmware to the **inactive** partition only
3. Updates `otadata` to boot from the new partition on next reset
4. Resets the device

**Rollback safety:** If the new firmware crashes before calling `esp_ota_mark_app_valid_cancel_rollback()`, the ESP-IDF bootloader automatically reverts to the previous partition. The old firmware is never overwritten.

### OTA via Feed (Preferred After First Flash)

Once the device is running this firmware, USB is rarely needed. Push a new build via the feed server instead:

```bash
# Build
pio run

# Copy firmware to feed server content dir
cp .pio/build/default/firmware.bin ~/crosspoint-feed/firmware/firmware.bin

# Restart feed server so it picks up the new file
systemctl --user restart crosspoint-feed

# Trigger a sync on the device
curl -X POST http://192.168.x.x/api/feed/sync
```

The device downloads `firmware.bin`, writes it to SD card, and flashes on next boot. After a successful flash, `firmware.bin` is automatically deleted from the SD card to prevent re-flashing.

### Iterative Development Loop

```
Write code → commit → pio run → copy firmware.bin to feed server
    → device syncs on next WiFi connect (or trigger manually)
    → check /.crosspoint/boot.log for flash result
    → monitor Serial for runtime logs
    → repeat
```

No USB flashing after the first setup. No physical access to the device needed.

### Serial Debugging

```bash
# Linux/Mac
python3 scripts/debugging_monitor.py

# macOS (adjust port)
python3 scripts/debugging_monitor.py /dev/cu.usbmodem101
```

RSS sync logs all activity to Serial in real time. System log files on the SD card (`/.crosspoint/boot.log`, `/.crosspoint/ota_error.log`) are also accessible via `GET /api/boot-log`.

### Screen Captures

```bash
# Capture current screen as PNG
curl http://192.168.x.x/api/screenshot > screen.png
```

Useful for verifying UI changes, attaching to bug reports, and documenting UI states.

### GitHub Issues

Always use `--repo laird/crosspoint-claw` when filing issues with `gh`:

```bash
gh issue create --repo laird/crosspoint-claw --title "..." --body "..."
```

Without `--repo`, `gh` defaults to the upstream repo (`crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader`).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Where to look |
|---------|---------------|
| Sync not starting | Check feed URL is set in Settings → NETW |
| Feed fetched but no files downloaded | Check `/.crosspoint/feed_sync_time.txt`; pull SD and inspect boot.log |
| Firmware not flashing | Confirm `firmware.bin` is in SD root; check `/.crosspoint/ota_error.log` |
| Device stuck in flash loop | Remove `firmware.bin` from SD card root; check GUID dedup in feed |
| Firmware re-flashing same version | GUID in feed must change between releases |
| Device booting old firmware after USB flash | otadata points to wrong partition — use https://xteink.dve.al/debug → "Swap boot partition" |
| Feed sync not triggering after WiFi connect | Hold Up/Down suppresses sync for that session — reconnect without holding |
